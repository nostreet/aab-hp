        <p>To inspire and empower people, it is all about the bees.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead"><b>What we are about:</b></p>
        <p>Many of our members have been looking after bees for some years now.
          We have a range of experiences from novice to advance, but even our
          advanced members are always learning something new. This gives rise
          to good discussions and information exchange. It is important that
          everybody gets involved and learns good practices. We want to contribute
          to the health of bees in New Zealand.<br><br>

          Our club is about creating an environment of learning, sharing ideas,
          knowledge.
          We are a small club, for now, 40 members, that means as well, we know
          each other. For the future the aim is to build strong relationships
          and networks for everybody to access and use.<br><br>

          We are very lucky to have Graeme Narbey as our mentor, who is
          passionate about bees, very knowledgeable, very generous and available.
          Beside Graeme we have a wealth of knowledge in our club, Clint and Steve,
          who are teaching on Sundays and Mondays, when Graeme is not available,
          and all our members, who are contributing.<br><br>

          We are in the process of planning to create a more formal network
          between our members. We want form groups of beekeepers who live
          in the same area and assign a mentor to each group and hope our
          communication will be much more effective and easier. Each of our
          club members contribute their creativity, knowledge and curiosity.
          We encourage everybody to participate in our activities and share
          their questions and knowledge. Together we are plentiful.
